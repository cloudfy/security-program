# Security Program

Implementing a security program is critical to ensure good code practices. Often many of the threats deal with the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.


As a minimum, a security program should include:

- Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Security and Licenses
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - code scanning
- Dynamic Application Security Test (DAST)
- Penetration Testing (PENTEST)
- Security Log Management (SLM)
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

- Secrets detection
- Container scanning
- Security Operations
- Infrastructure as code scanning
- Security Self-Assessment (SSA) or Security Posture.
- Data Protections Agreements and arrangements. Should be compromised into an ISAE 3000 GDPR.
- Bug bounty program
- Responsible Disclosure (RD)
